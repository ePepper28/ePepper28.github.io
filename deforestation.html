     <p> <h2> What is Deforestation Doing?</h2></p> 
     <p>Deforestation is being used to build new homes and other buildings in the place of areas of trees. However, animals homes are being destroyed and they are losing their shelters, sources of food, and in most cases they even lose their lives.</p>

        <ul>
           <li>Humans deforest around ten million hectares of forest every year.</li>
           <li>It is estimated that in 100 years rainforests will no longer exist.</li>
           <li>1 1/2 acres of forest are cut down every second.</li>
            <li>On average, 41 million trees are cut down each day, which means 15 billion per year.</li>
